%\todo{rewrite abstract; make it more exciting}
In the face of asymmetric information and comparative advantage, there may be opportunities to enrich long-term shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders. While these opportunities will typically fade over repeated opportunities, the long-term nature of insurance claims may provide opportunities for market timing.  One way insurance managers can enrich long-term shareholders is by issuing equity to take advantage of favorable reinsurance market conditions. This is analogous to a traditional capital structure exchange (in which managers issue equity and use the proceeds to retire debt), except that the insurer's obligations are stochastic. Our model suggests that under certain conditions (especially when reinsurance appears ``cheap''), managers can enrich long-term shareholders by issuing more equity and using the proceeds to purchase reinsurance.
