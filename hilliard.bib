   abstract = {Several explanations have been advanced in the financial economics literature to explain the reinsurance decision in insurance firms. Prominent amongst these is the risk-bearing hypothesis which holds that reinsurance is motivated by the ability of residual claimants to effectively hedge against operational risk. Since the efficiency of risk-bearing is influenced by organisational factors, such as ownership structure and firm size, the amount of reinsurance should also vary according to the characteristics of insurance firms. This study tests empirically the hypothesis that reinsurance is related to firm-specific factors. Using 1988–1993 data gathered from New Zealand's life insurance industry, a fixed-effects covariance regression model is estimated. Consistent with expectations, the results indicate that reinsurance is associated with smaller and more highly leveraged life insurance entities, and companies with greater underwriting risk. However, contrary to predictions, it also appears that it is stocks and companies with diversified production that tend to reinsure. The risk-bearing hypothesis thus receives only partial support.},

   abstract = {There are 2 prominent types of agency explanations for why managers choose to diversify their firms. The first type is that managers derive utility from reducing the idiosyncratic risk that they face. The second type is that managers diversify because they derive a private benefit from managing a more diversified firm. This study presents a model that incorporates both types of agency explanation. A contracting model is developed between shareholders and managers in which managers diversify their firms for 2 reasons: to reduce idiosyncratic risk and to capture private benefits. The comparative static predictions of the model are tested. In contrast to previous work, this study finds that diversification is positively related to managerial incentives. Further, the link between firm performance and managerial incentives is weaker for firms that experience changes in diversification than it is for firms that do not. Findings suggest that managers diversify their firms in response to changes in private benefits rather than to reduce their exposure to risk.},

The valuation effects are more favorable for non-bank acquirers and for acquirers with more growth potential and a lower degree of financial leverage. This suggests that investors expect greater synergies for mergers by better capitalized, faster growing, non-bank acquirers. In contrast to previous merger studies that generally find negative wealth effects for acquiring firms, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are on average positive for acquirers, targets, and portfolios of competing security firms, with the highest positive CARs for targets.},

The research finds that the valuation effects of the target, combined acquirer and target, and industry rivals of the target are positive and significant. The mean valuation effects per corresponding industry are significantly related to industry-specific characteristics that reflect the probability of a takeover. Specifically, industries characterized as having a higher level of free cash flow, a higher level of tangible assets, and a smaller market value experience a more favorable revaluation. A supplemental analysis of the individual rival firms is also conducted, since the variation in the valuation effects between rival firms within each of the industries is distinctly different from the variation of mean industry effect across industries. The analysis of the individual rivals finds that the same rival-specific variables are significant and in the same direction as the analysis of the industry-specific variables. In addition, the valuation effects of individual rivals are also inversely related to their previous performance. Overall, the results suggest that industry-specific and rival firm-specific characteristics that reflect a higher probability of a takeover are important in explaining acquisition gains and motivation.},

   abstract = {Bank acquisitions have increased in recent years, as more banks attempt to exploit potential synergies, economies of scale, and other benefits. Numerous studies have determined that bank acquisitions generate strong positive valuation effects for targets on average, while the evidence of the impact on acquirers is mixed. Our objectives are: (1) determine whether the announcement of a bank acquisition transmits intra-industry signals; (2) explain why the intra-industry effects vary across acquisition announcements; and (3) explain why the valuation effects of individual rival banks vary. We find that bank acquisition announcements generate significant positive intra-industry effects, on average. The intra-industry effects of rival bank portfolios are not uniform across announcements, as they are conditioned by variables that could signal information about the probability that rival banks will become takeover targets. The valuation effects of rival bank portfolios are positively related to the valuation effects of the target banks, and inversely related to the size and prior performance of rival bank portfolios. Furthermore, the valuation effects are more favorable for individual rival banks that are ultimately acquired. To the extent that these variables reflect the probability of being acquired in the future, the intra-industry effects appear to be more favorable for acquisitions in which there is a higher probability that the corresponding rivals will become targets. Overall, investors discriminate based on event-specific and rival bank-specific characteristics when interpreting the signal transmitted as a result of bank acquisitions.},

A typical dollar invested in the pharmaceutical sector experienced abnormal returns of 2.9 percent, while investments in healthcare facilities (including hospitals) experienced abnormal losses of 3.4 percent.

Results are shown to be stable across specification and estimation methods and to fit the data well. The transaction cost model is generally supported. The principal finding is that the greater the difficulty of evaluating a salesperson's performance, the more likely the firm to substitute surveillance for commission as a control mechanism, i.e., to use a direct sales force. Among other findings, direct sales forces are also associated with complex, hard-to-learn product lines and with districts that demand considerable nonselling activities. Several factors prove unrelated, including company size, the amount of travel a district requires, and the importance of key accounts.},

In a competitive capital market, the cost of equity capital (the expected return on equity) increases with the risk of firms' investments. Because accounting earnings are calculated without deducting the cost of equity capital, they are expected to be an increasing function of firms' investment risks. This simple competitive equilibrium analysis predicts a positive relation between changes in investment risk and expected earnings. The presence of corporate debt complicates the analysis because leverage effects seem likely to affect the relation between changes in investment risk and expected earnings. Using annual earnings and return data from 1950 to 1988, we document a statistically significant positive association between changes in equities' relative risks and in earnings. However, on average, only a small proportion of changes in earnings can be attributed to changes in risk. A much larger proportion is attributable to changes in economic rents (windfall gains and losses). The observed positive association between changes in earnings and changes in equities' risks suggests that leverage effects do not fully offset the effect of changes in investment risks. This association is robust with respect to subperiod analysis, alternative specifications of the earnings change variable, alternative data-availability requirements, and the number of portfolios formed.},

Revelation of trust membership or prior stock market mispricing are also unlikely alternative explanations. On balance, therefore, the evidence indicates that these mergers were generally motivated by more efficient operations, rather than monopoly power.},

   abstract = {This article is the first step toward integrating in a single framework two previously separate lines of research on major structural decisions of life insurers. The literature has previously studied the relation between capital structure and asset risk on the one hand, and the relation between organizational form and distribution system on the other hand, without integrating them. Using life insurer data for 1993–1999, we model the four key insurer decisions of capital structure, asset risk, organizational form, and distribution system as endogenous choices in a single interrelated set of simultaneous equations. The model assesses the nature of the interactions among these decisions. The model also assesses the impact of insurers' fundamental business strategy (treated as predetermined) on these choices. The business-strategy hypothesis views other key decisions as jointly determined and driven by the fundamental business strategy, once the latter is set in motion. Confirming previous studies, we find a positive relation between capital ratios and asset risk. We also find an association in the simultaneous context between stock ownership and brokerage distribution, which was not found in prior studies. Stock ownership is related to greater financial and asset risk taking, whereas brokerage distribution is associated with lower risk taking. These and other results are interpreted in light of several theories, including transaction-cost economics (TCE), agency theory, and regulatory and bankruptcy cost avoidance. Deriving from these theories, the finite risk paradigm emerges as the most comprehensive interpretation of the results, as opposed to the risk-subsidy hypothesis of the impact of guarantee funds. We also find support for the notion that the business strategy drives the capital and distribution decisions, as predicted by TCE.},

To examine this issue, we use a simultaneous-equation partial-adjustment model. Three equations express the interrelations among capital and two measures of risk: product risk and asset risk. The asset-risk measure used in this paper reflects credit or solvency risk as in RBC. Product risk assessment for life insurance products is rationalized by transaction-cost economics – contractual uncertainty. A significant finding is that for life insurers the relation between capital and asset risk is positive. This agrees with prior studies for the property/casualty insurance industry and some banking studies. But the relation between capital and product risk is negative. This is consistent with the hypothesized impact of guarantee funds in other studies. The contrast between the positive relation of capital to asset risk and the negative relation of capital to product risk underscores the importance of distinguishing these two components of risk.},

The current study extends the investigation through 1990, links the empirical evidence with the logic of agency theory, and provides an alternative measurement of marketing methods. The existence of a cost differential is reaffirmed, and the alternate marketing specification shows that exclusive agency firms have lower expenses than independent agency firms but that direct mail merchandisers have lower expenses than either type of agency firm.

   abstract = {A theory of salesforce compensation plans is presented where the sales of a product depend not only on the salesperson's effort but also on the uncertainty in the selling environment. The firm chooses a compensation plan to maximize its profit taking into account the salesperson's likely effort levels under alternative compensation plans and his or her alternative job opportunities. The salesperson (agent) chooses an effort level considering both the disutility from effort and the expected utility from earnings under the compensation plan. The Agency Theory framework provides an explanation for the differences across firms in the types of compensation plans used such as straight salary, straight commissions, or a combination of salary and commissions. It is shown that the optimal compensation plan is a convex (concave) increasing function of sales if the risk tolerance of the salesperson increases "rapidly" (stays constant) with income. We identify several structural parameters that affect the compensation plan and show that the implication of changes in some of these parameters is consistent with those mentioned in the sales management literature. For example, we show that the proportion of salary to total compensation would increase with an increase in one or more of the following parameters: (i) uncertainty, (ii) marginal cost of production, and (iii) attractiveness of alternative job opportunities for the salesperson. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the theory for managing salesforce compensation plans.},

The DEA results show the typical hospital services industry experienced 11 percent inefficiency in 1999. Moreover, multiple regression analysis indicates the level of technical efficiency varied directly across metropolitan hospital services industries in response to greater HMO activity and private health insurer concentration in the state. The analysis suggests the degree of rivalry among hospitals had no marginal effect on technical efficiency at the industry level. Evidence also implies that the presence of a state Certificate of Need law was not associated with a greater degree of inefficiency in the typical metropolitan hospital services industry.},

The empirical results provide evidence that greater health insurer buyer concentration is not associated with monopsony power.

That is, metropolitan hospitals offer increased services when the buyer-side of the hospitals services market is more highly concentrated.},

Bank holding companies (BHCs), however, did not issue these trust-preferred securities (TPS) until 1996, when the Federal Reserve qualified them as Tier-1 capital. We delineate and test five, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses by: (1) analyzing the stock-market's reaction to the Fed's ruling and to TPS filings and (2) comparing BHCs that issued TPS with those that did not. We find that regulatory capital requirements, tax savings, and uninsured sources of funds had significant positive effects on BHCs' demand for capital and that the market responded favorably to TPS filings. Our event-study findings are contrary to prior empirical results in that we find a positive market reaction to equity offerings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This cooperative equilibrium is very simple and attractive: each firm sets the collusive output price, and employs a commission scheme to compensate the agent. Although each firm has the ability to condition compensation on the agent's action (as well as on sales), firms choose to forego this opportunity. In essence, common agency provides an indirect mechanism through which competing firms may "sell out" to a single party, thereby creating incentives which generate a collusive outcome.},

It then reviews in detail how event studies have been used to evaluate the wealth effects of corporate litigation: defendants experience economically meaningful and statistically significant wealth losses upon the filing of the suit, whereas plaintiff firms experience no significant wealth effects upon filing a lawsuit. Also, there is a significant wealth increase for defendant firms when they settle a suit with another firm, in contrast to other types of plaintiffs, and in contrast to the settling plaintiff firms. These findings suggest that, at a minimum, lawsuits are not a value-enhancing way for corporations to settle their disagreements with other corporations. In addition, the market appears to impose a higher sanction on firms than actual criminal sanctions, and reputational losses are of equal magnitude for civil fines as for criminal ones. The article concludes with some recommendations for researchers: the standards for conducting an event study are well established; researchers can increase the power of an event study by increasing the sample size, and by narrowing the public announcement period to as short a time frame as possible. The companion article reviews the use of event studies in corporate law and regulation.},

In this part we focus on the methodology's application to corporate law and corporate governance issues. Event studies have played an important role in the making of corporate law and in corporate law scholarship. The reason for this input is twofold. First, there is a match between the methodology and subject matter: the goal of corporate law is to increase shareholder wealth, and event studies provide a metric for measurement of the impact upon stock prices of policy decisions. Second, because the participants in corporate law debates share the objective of corporate law, to adopt policies that enhance shareholder wealth, their disagreements are over the means to achieve that end. Hence, the discourse can be empirically informed. The article concludes by sketching the methodology's use in evaluating the economic effects of regulation. While event studies' usefulness for policy analysis is by now familiar in the corporate law setting, we hope that our two-part review will suggest appropriate applications to other fields of law.},

Without Florida in the sample, there is no detectable impact of right-to-carry laws on the rate of murder and rape, the two crimes that by the calculations of Lott and Mustard account for 80 percent of the social benefit of right-to-carry laws. A more general model based on year-to-year differences yields no evidence of significant impact for any type of violent crime. As a result, inference based on the Lott and Mustard model is inappropriate, and their results cannot be used responsibly to formulate public policy.},

We test for whether out-of-pocket or total premium better explains worker behavior, estimate price elasticities with observed prices and with imputed prices, and test for worker sorting among jobs with and without health insurance. We find that out-of-pocket price dominates, that there is some upward bias from estimating elasticities with imputed premiums rather than observed premiums, and that workers do sort among jobs but this does not affect elasticity estimates appreciably. Like earlier studies with less representative worker samples, we find worker price elasticity of demand to be quite low. This suggests that any premium subsidies must be large to elicit much change in worker take-up behavior.},

If the market shall reach a Pareto optimal state, there must be negotiations between the participants, and it seems that the problem can best be analysed as an n-person cooperative game. The paper is written in the terminology of reinsurance markets. The theoretical model studied should be applicable also to stock exchanges and other markets where the participants seek to reach an optimal distribution of risk.},

Furthermore, if the proportion of Dares is large enough, then the pooling contract, the amount of fraud and the number of agents found to have committed fraud are independent of the Dares' exact proportion in the economy. Finally, I show that investment in prevention can be useless if the proportion of Dares is large enough, which means that investing in prevention becomes a waste of resources. This last result holds when the proportion of Dares is large. When their proportion is small, investing in prevention reduces fraud.},

Affective decision making (ADM) is a strategic model of choice under risk and uncertainty where we posit two cognitive processes—the “rational” and the “emotional” process. The two processes interact in a simultaneous-move intrapersonal potential game, and observed choice is the result of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. We show that regular ADM potential games have an odd number of locally unique pure strategy Nash equilibria, and demonstrate this finding for affective decision making in insurance markets. We prove that ADM potential games are refutable by axiomatizing the ADM potential maximizers.},

Within this financial intermediary approach, solvency can be a primary concern for regulators of insurance companies, claims-paying ability can be a primary concern for policyholders, and return on investment can be a primary concern for investors. These three variables (solvency, financial return, and claims-paying ability) are considered as outputs of the insurance firm. The financial intermediary approach acknowledges that interests potentially conflict, and the strategic decision makers for the firm must balance one concern versus another when managing the insurance company. Accordingly, we investigate the efficiency of insurance companies using data envelopment analysis (DEA) having as insurer output an appropriately selected (for the firm under investigation) combination of solvency, claims-paying ability, and return on investment as outputs. These efficiency evaluations are further examined to study stock versus mutual form of organizational structure and agency versus direct marketing arrangements, which are examined separately and in combination. Comparisons with the “value-added” or “production” approach to insurer efficiency are presented. A new DEA approach and interpretation is also presented.},

Thus, the “150-hour rule” should increase the cost of becoming a CPA and, consequently, reduce the supply of new CPAs. We test this hypothesis using panel data on the number of first-time candidates for the CPA exam in each state over the years 1985 to 2002. We find that the imposition of the 150-hour education requirement reduces the number of candidates sitting for the CPA exam by 60 percent and that the “grandfathering” provisions of the 150-hour rule produce a substantial transitory increase in the number of candidates sitting for the exam in the year prior to the rule’s effective date. Examination of candidates’ pass rates on the exam also finds behavior consistent with the hypothesis that the 150-hour rule is a barrier to entry.},

Assuming that the premium calculation principle is a convex functional we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions and provide a necessary optimality condition (via needle-like perturbations, widely known in optimal control). These results are used to find the optimal reinsurance policy when the reinsurance loading is increasing with the variance. The optimal contract is described by a nonlinear function, of a similar form than in the aggregate case.},

Further, we compare the differences in efficiency scores before and after the change of distribution channel strategy. The results suggest that a direct distribution channel strategy performs better than a non-direct distribution channel strategy in terms of efficiency and productivity change.

Three-stage least squares estimation is used to investigate the relationship between capital and two types of risk: underwriting and asset risk.

This positive relationship was not consistently significant in 1993, prior to the implementation of risk-based capital (RBC) requirements. Both under-capitalised insurers and marginally adequately capitalised insurers adjusted their capital and risk towards firm targets at a higher speed than well-capitalised insurers in the post-RBC period. But underwriting and asset risk also increased for less well-capitalised insurers. © 2013 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.},

   abstract = {This study examines the relationships among market structure and performance in property-liability insurers over the period 1992-1998 using data at the company and group levels. Three specific hypotheses are tested: traditional structure-conduct-performance, relative market power, and efficient structure (ES). The results provide support for the ES hypothesis. The ES hypothesis posits that more efficient firms can charge lower prices than competitors, enabling them to capture larger market shares and economic rents, leading to increased concentration. Both revenue and cost efficiency are used in the analysis, and this is the first study to use revenue efficiency in this type of analysis. The results for the sample period as a whole and by year are consistent. The overall results suggest that cost-efficient firms charge lower prices and earn higher profits, in conformance with the ES hypothesis. On the other hand, prices and profits are found to be higher for revenue-efficient firms. Revenue X-efficiency is derived from activities such as cross-selling and may rely heavily on the use of detailed information from customer databases to identify potential customers. The implications of this research are that regulators should be more concerned with efficiency (both cost and revenue) rather than the market power that arises from the consolidation activity taking place in insurance.},

After summarizing the key findings of these studies, the current status of the contingent commission debate in the U.S., Australia and the EU is examined in an effort to identify important factors for the EC and others around the world to consider in assessing the effects of contingent commissions on competition and the need for regulatory responses, if any, to adequately protect consumers.

The paper proposes a system of insurance regulation that both overcomes the numerous criticisms of the current state-based regulatory system, and achieves the purported advantages of an optional federal charter (OFC) system, but without the creation of the type of dual federal-state regulation envisioned in the current OFC legislation.

   abstract = {Since legislation to establish an Optional Federal Charter (OFC) for "national insurers" was first formally introduced Feb. 14, 2002, its proponents have contended that its adoption would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of insurance regulation in the same way regulatory choice and competition have purportedly improved banking supervision. They also claim that an OFC would permit greater product innovation and lower costs due to uniform national standards achieved through federal preemption of state laws. Examination of these two claims suggests that creation of an OFC is even less likely to provide an adequate basis for improving insurance regulation through federal-state regulatory competition than has been the case in the banking system. In addition, efforts to achieve uniformity through sweeping federal preemption since 2004 has left consumers of mortgage loans from national banks and their subsidiaries severely harmed. In response, the Obama Administration and Congress are undertaking several steps to reduce federal preemption in banking and strengthen consumer protection through creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency-steps that might also be taken in the event of ineffective consumer protection in the course of federal regulation of national insurers, agencies and producers under an OFC regulatory system.

   abstract = {Many firms that sponsor traditional defined benefit pensions have converted these plans to cash balance plans in the last en years. Cash balance plans in the last ten years combine features of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, and yet their introduction has proven considerably more controversial than has the increasing popularity of defined contribution plans. The goal of this study is to estimate a hierarchy of the influences on the decision of a firm to convert its traditional defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan. Our results indicate that cash balance conversions have been undertaken in competitive industries with tight labor markets and thus can be viewed at least in part as a response to better compensate a more mobile labor force. Indeed, many firms appear to increase their pension liabilities through such conversions.},

The findings on regulating prices in these markets are consistent with a broad literature in regulation that demonstrates conclusively that price regulation is generally bad for most consumers.

(brokers and independent agents), focusing on the commercial
property–casualty insurance market. The article investigates the functions
performed by intermediaries, the competitiveness of the market, the compensation
arrangements for intermediaries, and the process by which policies
are placed with insurers. Insurance intermediaries are essentially market
makers who match the insurance needs of policyholders with insurers
who have the capability of meeting those needs. Intermediary compensation
comprises premium-based commissions, expressed as a percentage of
the premium paid, and contingent commissions based on the profitability,
persistency, and/or volume of the business placed with the insurer. Empirical
evidence is provided that premium-based and contingent commissions
are passed on to policyholders in the premium. However, contingent commissions
can enhance competitive bidding by aligning the insurer’s and the
intermediary’s interests. This alignment of interests gives insurers more confidence
in the selection of risks and thus helps to break the “winner’s curse”
and encourages insurers to bid more aggressively. Independent intermediaries
also help markets operate more efficiently by reducing the information
asymmetries between insurers and buyers that can cause adverse selection.},

However, most practical applications of these models have not taken into account either the effects of firm capital structure or the differences in financial risk across lines of insurance. The objective of this paper is to provide a first step towards remedying these deficiencies by providing theoretical and empirical evidence on the effects of capital structure and line of business risk on the cost of equity capital in property-liability insurance. A theoretical model is developed that expresses the cost of capital as a function of both insurance leverage (the ratio of policy reserves to assets) and financial leverage (the ratio of financial debt to assets). The model is tested using data on traded stock property-liability insurers over the period 1980-1989. The results indicate that the cost of equity capital is sensitive to both insurance and financial leverage and that the cost of equity is higher for firms writing long-tail commercial lines such as general liability and workers' compensation. Thus, both leverage and line of business specialization should be taken into account in using the cost of equity capital in pricing property-liability insurance.},

At this juncture, securitization has a role to play by passing the risks along to broader capital markets.

When we used the total rather than the underwriting costs to measure expenses, we found that the relative but not the absolute expense differential was reduced. This suggests that the inefficiencies of the independent agency companies stem from marketing and administrative rather than loss adjustment procedures.

Data on the private insurance sector is extremely difficult to obtain because health insurance contracts are complex, renegotiated annually, and not subject to reporting requirements. This study makes use of a privately-gathered national database of insurance contracts agreed upon by a sample of large, multisite employers between 1998 and 2005. To gauge the competitiveness of the group health insurance industry, I investigate whether health insurers charge higher premiums, ceteris paribus, to more profitable firms. I find they do, and this result is not driven by cross-sectional differences across firms or plans: firms with positive profit shocks subsequently face higher premium growth, even for the same health plans. Moreover, this relationship is strongest in geographic markets served by a small number of insurance carriers. Further analysis suggests profits act to increase employers’ switching costs, and insurers exploit this inelasticity where they have sufficient bargaining power. Given the rapid industry consolidation during the study period, these findings suggest healthcare insurers possess and exercise market power in an increasing number of geographic markets.},

   abstract = {This paper provides evidence on the valuation effects of convertible debt issuance. Common stockholders earn significant negative abnormal returns at the initial announcement of a convertible debt offering, and also at the issuance date. In contrast, the average valuation effect on common stock at the announcement of non-convertible debt offerings is only marginally negative, and is zero at issuance. The significant negative average effect on common stock value appears not to be systematically related to either the degree of leverage change induced by the convertible debt issuance or the extent to which the proceeds from issuance are used for new investment or to refinance existing debt. If, as appears likely, the issuance of convertible debt on average increases financial leverage, these results are inconsistent with evidence from other recent studies documenting common stock price effects of the same sign as the change in leverage. The evidence suggests that convertible debt offerings convey unfavorable information about the issuing firms, but the specific nature of such information remains unidentified.},

We develop and test the hypothesis that rate suppression exacerbates loss growth, leading to higher losses and premiums. The empirical analysis using rating class data for eight states for the period 1985-91 confirms that rate suppression, measured by lagged residual-market share of payroll, increased loss growth. The cost-increasing effects are greater in the residual market than in the voluntary market, but premiums increased more rapidly in the voluntary market. The resulting pattern of cross subsidies between and within classes is consistent with a simple model of political influence, with subsidies to high risks and small firms at the expense of low risks and insurer equity.},

   journal = {National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series},
   volume = {No. 4777},
   abstract = {In its attempt to model financial markets and the behavior of firms, modern finance theory starts from a set of normatively appealing axioms about individual behavior. Specifically, people are said to be risk-averse expected utility maximizers and unbiased Bayesian forecasters, i.e., agents make rational choices based on rational expectations. The rational paradigm may be criticized, however, because (1) the assumptions are descriptively false and incomplete, and (2) the theory often lacks predictive power. One way to make progress is to characterize actual decision- making behavior. Efforts along these lines are made by behavioral economists and psychologists. This paper provides a selective review of recent work in behavioral finance. First, we ask why economists should be concerned with the psychology of decision-making. Next, we discuss a series of key behavioral concepts, e.g., people's well-known tendencies to give too much weight to vivid information and to show excessive self-confidence. The body of the paper illustrates the relevance of these concepts to important topics in investment theory and corporate finance. In each case, behavioral finance offers a new perspective on results that are anomalous within the standard approach.},

Expanding on Modigliani and Miller [1958, 1963], the cost of equity capital can be expressed as a function of leverage and corporate and investor level taxes. Based on this expression, we predict that the cost of equity is increasing in leverage, and that corporate taxes mitigate this leverage-related risk premium, while the personal tax disadvantage of debt increases this premium. We empirically test these predictions using implied cost of equity estimates and proxies for the firm's corporate tax rate and the personal tax disadvantage of debt. Our results suggest that the equity risk premium associated with leverage is decreasing in the corporate tax benefit from debt. We find some evidence that the equity risk premium from leverage is increasing in the personal tax penalty associated with debt.

Fragility commits banks to creating liquidity, enabling depositors to withdraw when needed, while buffering borrowers from depositors' liquidity needs. Stabilization policies, such as capital requirements, narrow banking, and suspension of convertibility, may reduce liquidity creation.},

Since a collusive, anticompetitive merger generates an increase in the industry's quality-adjusted product price (or a decrease in factor prices), it also follows from the doctrine that the merger-induced expected benefits to the product market rivals of the merging firms should be an increasing function of the concentration change. The empirical results of this paper, which are based on the industry wealth effect of a large sample of horizontal mergers, including cases found in violation of antimonopoly laws, fail to support this prediction. This conclusion is robust with respect to assumptions concerning the probability that a proposed merger will be prevented by the law enforcement agencies, and it continues to hold after transforming the industry wealth effect into a hypothetical, constant expected change in the industry's product price. The results imply that the levels of concentration and market shares found in the Department of Justice's merger guidelines are unlikely to identify truly anticompetitive mergers.},

We show how such concepts as prudence and temperance can be fully characterized by a preference relation over these lotteries.

What makes our characterization appealing is its simplicity, which seems particularly amenable to experimentation.},

The reaction of rivals to AIG-related events depends on the relative strength of two competing effects. The contagion effect implies that rival returns will decrease following negative events affecting AIG. In contrast, competitive effects will occur if investors expect that rivals will be able to benefit from AIG's downfall. Using three-factor multivariate regression model event study methodology, we find evidence of both effects around several key dates in AIG's decline.},

We identify a 52.3 percent decline in market‐adjusted prices, which we then associate with health care reform. Applying a new technique, isotonic regression, we find most of the decline occurred gradually. Much of the decline occurred as the Clinton plan adopted strategies to contain health care costs, including “managed competition” and implicit regulation. Indirect evidence suggests that the wealth lost by pharmaceutical companies may have been largely an anticipated transfer. Our results are relevant to understanding the likely effects of the Clinton plan and more recent proposals. Many other policy changes are marked by gradual public revelation of information, which may not be completely observable by a researcher. Our approach may uncover information about the anticipated effects of policies unavailable from a traditional event study.},

It examines a measure of diversification gains from potential consolidation, based on option pricing, and a model of the “building blocks” of the industries, based on arbitrage pricing theory.

The two functions usually attributed to the entrepreneur--management and risk bearing--are treated as naturally separate factors within the set of contracts called a firm. The firm is disciplined by competition from other firms, which forces the evolution of devides for efficiently monitoring the performance of the entire team and of its individual members.

This class has the topology of a circle. Half the circle corresponds to CRRA utility, for which the consumption domain is bounded below. The other half, which includes quadratic utility, is characterized by consumption domains which are bounded above. Both types of consumption bounds can present difficulties when these utility functions are used in optimization problems. However, the mathematics underlying both types of difficulties is the same. In the context of a consumption/saving problem, a unified theory exists describing policy functions for the entire HARA class. The resulting perturbation series diverges for large lifetimes if interest rates are below the discount rate when the consumption domain is bounded from below. Likewise, they can diverge if interest rates are above the discount rate when the consumption domain is bounded from above.},

This paper strongly suggests that the merger will have adverse consequences for consumers. I use a model of health plan rivalry and empirical demand functions to predict that health insurance premiums in 6 Twin Cities firms will rise by as much as 19 percent after the merger. Next, I show how to calculate the loss in consumer surplus in a â€˜discrete choiceâ€™ model and predict that the merger will reduce surplus by 4,4% on average. Several objections to these conclusions are considered but, on the whole, the analysis raises serious concerns for public policy toward HMO mergers.

The result is high reinsurance premiums and cross-subsidization of high-risk insurers by low-risk insurers. A contract with a parametric or index trigger (such as a catastrophe bond) is insensitive to information asymmetry and therefore alters the equilibrium in the reinsurance market. Provided that basis risk is not too high, the introduction of contracts with parametric or index triggers provides low-risk insurers with an alternative to reinsurance contracts, and therefore leads to less cross-subsidization in the reinsurance market.},

The financial contagion adversely affected the entire hybrid capital securities market for six months. The effect was most pronounced among those hybrids that were eventually reclassified as common equity equivalents.

   pages = {3041-3071},
   abstract = {In 2004, the property-casualty insurance industry was roiled by a scandal unparalleled in its history, with the world's largest insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, accused of defrauding customers by rigging bids to maximize its own profits. In addition to its sensational bid-rigging charges, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's October 2004 suit against Marsh challenged insurers' long-established practice of paying insurance brokers and agents (or producers) additional compensation contingent on their sales volume and the profitability of their risks. Spitzer argues that such contingent commissions are not adequately disclosed to insurance buyers and can have anticompetitive effects. Indeed, in Spitzer's view, a broad spectrum of financial arrangements entered into by carriers and independent producers threaten the competitiveness of the P&C insurance market. But I argue that, rather than promoting competition, an industry-wide ban on contingent compensation might instead undermine the financial stability of small insurance agencies in communities throughout America. Ironically, this could well lead to the further consolidation of insurance brokerage business in large global firms like Marsh. Indeed, the state of affairs that first drew Attorney General Spitzer's attention--large commercial insurance brokers allegedly manipulating the market for their own benefit--was the result of nothing so much as the coupling of time-honored sales incentive practices developed on Main Street, USA with an unprecedented level of market power attained by a few global mega-brokers following a consolidation spree in the 1990s. It would be an expensive mistake, however, to jump from that observation to the conclusion that all contingent compensation of all insurance producers is necessarily harmful to insurance consumers. This article (i) traces the history of Attorney General Spitzer's investigation into insurance market practices, (ii) offers an overview of producer compensation practices as they have evolved in the U.S. P&C market, (iii) outlines recent regulatory and legislative responses to the Spitzer investigation, and (iv) suggests a simple, voluntary reform that would increase transparency for insurance consumers while avoiding the pitfalls likely to attend more draconian solutions. },

   abstract = {In principle, market and government supervision provide alternative devices for controlling (governing) any type of corporation. Most national governments have instituted nonmarket regulatory mechanisms for banking firms, on the grounds that market-based mechanisms do not adequately discipline banks. But what evidence supports this assessment? Why must governments assure bank solvency, but not the solvency of other firms? Government oversight naturally displaces private efforts to evaluate and control financial firms. Moreover, if the banking business changes over time-as it assuredly has in the past decade or two-the best combination of government and private supervision may change concurrently. This paper reviews and evaluates the growing empirical literature on private investors' abilities to assess the financial condition of banking firms. The evidence supports the proposition that market investors and analysts could reasonably provide a greater proportion of corporate governance services for large, traded U.S. financial firms.},

Moreover, financing imperfections can give rise to intermediary market power, so that small changes in financial imperfections can give rise to large changes in price. We develop tests of this alternative against the null that the supply of intermediary capital is perfectly elastic. We take the US catastrophe reinsurance market as an example, using detailed data from Guy Carpenter & Co., covering a large fraction of the catastrophe risks exchanged during 1970-94. Our results suggest that the price of reinsurance generally exceeds "fair" values, particularly in the aftermath of large events, that market power of reinsurers is not a complete explanation for such pricing, and that reinsurers' high costs of capital appear to play an important role.},

When compared with CAPM-based models of the insurer, a number of important insights emerge. First, the option pricing framework is shown to encompass the CAPM framework as a special case and may help to explain a number of empirical phenomena. Second, the option pricing framework is used to develop a "risk incentive" hypothesis which suggests that limited liability and asymmetric taxes provide mutuals with greater disincentives for riskbearing than stock companies, even in the absence of owner/manager conflicts.},

This article considers one specific contractual arrangement that helps resolve the risk shifting problem in stock insurers: the inclusion of participation rights in insurance policies. We assume that the insurer chooses between two mutually exclusive investment portfolios, where the riskier portfolio is a mean preserving spread of the less risky portfolio. The primary purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate that participating insurance policies resolve the risk shifting problem for stock insurers. We also present empirical evidence on policyholder participation that is consistent with our theory.},

The optimal strategy for capital accumulation and insurance demand is derived in the constant relative risk aversion case.

This concept is called risk vulnerability. It is equivalent to the condition that an undesirable risk can never be made desirable by the presence of an independent, unfair risk. Moreover, under risk vulnerability, adding an unfair background risk reduces the demand for risky assets. Risk vulnerability generalizes the concept of properness (individually undesirable, independent risks are always jointly undesirable) introduced by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987). It implies that the two first derivatives of the utility function are concave transformations of the original utility function. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, a sufficient condition for risk vulnerability is local properness, i.e. r" ≥ r'r, where r is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion.},

We test the hypothesis that the RBC system has at least as much power for identifying financially weak insurers as the FAST scoring system does. Our empirical results are largely inconsistent with this hypothesis: RBC ratios are less powerful than FAST scores in identifying financially weak property-liability insurers during our sample periods. We also provide limited evidence that RBC ratios and FAST scores are jointly more powerful in identifying weak insurers than FAST scores alone, which suggests that RBC ratios may convey new information about insolvency risk despite their relatively low power on a univariate basis.},

We then estimate the short-run link between the industry and the general economy using vector autoregression techniques and find that, although the property-liability insurance industry is linked to the long-run performance of the national economy, short-run shocks in economic variables have little effect on the combined ratio.},

I infer how aggressively a firm uses debt by observing the shape of its tax benefit function. Paradoxically, large, liquid, profitable firms with low expected distress costs use debt conservatively.

We document a significant and predictable stock price response at each of these three events. Our tests also indicate that the market interprets these events not in isolation but as sequential and conditional events. Investor response differs on the basis of the characteristics of the issuer, the allegations in the complaint, and the outcome of the litigation. These results and the fact that we observe no systematic price momentum in investor response beyond the announcement dates imply that the market is reasonably efficient with respect to information about securities fraud litigation. Our results are robust to alternative definitions and procedures, and are based on a proprietary database that includes almost all federal securities class action lawsuits since 1990.

Arbitrage theories imply no systematic relationship between capacity and underwriting margins, while capacity-constraint hypotheses predict a negative relationship. This article provides a test of the two theories by examining the empirical relationship between capacity and underwriting margins. The results, using data on four insurance lines, generally support the capacity-constraint hypothesis; unanticipated decreases in capacity cause higher profitability and prices.},

I do so by putting together data from more than a decade of Current Population Survey (CPS) data sets, and matching to workers in those data sets their tax subsidies to health insurance coverage. I find that the elasticity of insurance eligibility of workers is at least -0.6, and that the elasticity of own insurance coverage is roughly similar; the results imply that most of the impact of taxes on insurance coverage arise through firm offering and eligibility decisions. I also find that higher tax rates induce more private coverage through other sources, but less public coverage, so that overall there is a reduction in the rate of uninsurance that is comparable to the change in own employer-provided insurance coverage.},

The methodology also allows for the possibility that the standard deviations of the disturbances may be (1) negatively related to insurer size and (2) greater for nonagency insurers than for agency insurers of equal size. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to analyze the properties of the ML estimator in view of the fact that the nonagency group includes only nine insurers. The results suggest that economies of scale may be more pronounced for the nonagency insurers than for the agency insurers in the sample.

   journal = {Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis},
   abstract = {Widely used test statistics for non-zero mean abnormal returns in short-horizon event studies ignore cross-firm variation in event effects. Cross-sectional regression analyses of abnormal returns often either ignore heteroskedasticity in model disturbances or ignore plausible implications of unexplained variation in effects for the structure of heteroskedasticity. We use a simple model of event effects and simulations patterned after Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) and Boehmer, Musumeci, and Poulsen (BMP, 1991) to highlight the resulting biases and the importance of using test procedures that appropriately allow for cross-sectional variation. We demonstrate analytically how cross-sectional variation produces "event-induced" variance increases and biases popular tests for non-zero mean abnormal returns. Our simulations provide evidence of that bias and of test power for several theoretically robust tests for non-zero means, including the standardized cross-sectional test statistic suggested by BMP, which we show equals the mean standardized prediction error divided by a heteroskedasticity-consistent standard error, and cross-sectional regression tests that condition on relevant regressors. We also analyze and provide evidence of bias and power for alternative tests for non-zero slopes in abnormal return regression models with heteroskedastic errors attributable to cross-firm variation in event effects and market model disturbance variances. Neither OLS nor WLS has good properties. WLS with robust standard errors and maximum likelihood estimation assuming non-proportional heteroskedasticity may represent useful supplements to OLS with robust standard errors.},

Finally, the event period cumulative abnormal returns for additions are significantly associated with the decrease in the effective spread, particularly the decline in the direct cost of transacting. In contrast, the liquidity of deleted stocks declines over the three months following deletion.},

Larger institutions in all three financial sectors earn higher abnormal returns. Additionally, better performing banks earn higher abnormal returns.

In a differentiated insurance market under imperfect information, consumers can gain information about product suitability by consulting an intermediary. We analyze current broker compensation methods: commissions and fees. Although insurers' equilibrium profits are equivalent under both systems, social welfare is always higher under a fee-for-advice system than under a commission system. Both systems offer the opportunity to increase profits via collusion. Under a commission system, collusion enables insurers to separate consumers into groups purchasing different contracts. Insurers may then extract additional rents from some consumers. This advantage can explain why brokers tend to be compensated by insurers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This paper reviews the existing data and risk indices in environmental finance. The main purpose of the paper is to analyse existing sustainability and ethical indices in environmental finance, and evaluate empirical environmental risk by estimating conditional volatility clustering that is inherent in these indices. Financial volatility models are estimated to analyse the underlying conditional volatility or time-varying risk that is inherent in alternative environmental sustainability indices. Volatility clustering is observed for most series, but some extreme observations are also evident. The log- and second-moment conditions suggest that valid inferences can be drawn for purposes of sensible empirical analysis.},

Overall, we find that loan growth at subsidiary banks is more sensitive to the holding company's cash flow and capital position than to the bank's own cash flow and capital. Moreover, we find that bank loan growth is negatively correlated with loan growth among the other subsidiaries within the holding company. Overall, this evidence suggests that bank holding companies establish internal capital markets to allocate scarce capital among their various subsidiaries.},

This article tests the practical validity of most of the analytic arguments regarding corporate demand for insurance. In general, the empirical evidence from corporate property insurance purchases is consistent with the various theoretical arguments regarding corporate demand for insurance. The results suggest insurance helps to reduce various agency costs associated with stakeholder conflicts, provides real services, and reduces taxes. Finally, the less risky nature of regulated industries compared with unregulated industries is believed to lessen the various corporate incentives to purchase property insurance.},

This paper provides a theoretical model of hidden overconfidence and demonstrates that a competitive insurance market may settle on separating equilibrium with advantageous selection predicting a negative relationship between risk and coverage. By assuming heterogeneity in risk perception and hidden action on self-protection, we find that, in equilibrium, the rational type of individual takes precautions to reduce the loss probability, whereas the overconfident type of individual will not make any effort. In the separating equilibrium, the insurer provides a product with high coverage to attract rational type of individual (low risk), and a product with low coverage for overconfident type of individual (high risk). In addition, other types of equilibrium such as adverse selection or linear premium rate are also found.},

We characterize how the equilibrium amount of misselling (and thus the scope of policy intervention) depends on features of the agency problem including: the internal organization of a firm's sales process, the transparency of its commission structure, and the steepness of its agents' sales incentives.},

Three classes of RPM theories are tested: the supplier and dealer anticompetitive theories, and the class of principle-agent theories. The article uses both ex ante and ex post tests to distinguish the theories, including tests based on structural evidence, as well as data on sales, advertising, and stock market reactions for the company and its competitors around critical events in the case. The evidence most convincingly rejects the anticompetitive theories and points toward a principle-agent explanation in which RPM helped increase sales of Corning's products. The case is of interest, in part, because the "simple" products at issue in the case are not the types of products most often associated with potential efficiency explanations for RPM.},

Insider trading patterns shows that low valuation firms are regarded as undervalued by their own managers relative to high valuation firms. This finding is robust to controlling for noninformation motivated trading. Further evidence links managers' private portfolio decisions to changes in corporate capital structures, suggesting that managers try to actively time the market both in their private trades and in firm-level decisions.},

Despite a competitive market structure, however, the property-liability insurance industry has traditionally set prices through cartel-like rating bureaus and has been subjected to pervasive state rate regulation. The study concludes that the combination of state regulation, cartel pricing, and other legal peculiarities has resulted in the use of an inefficient sales technique, supply shortages, and over-capitalization. Free entry, however, tends to drive profits toward the cost of capital. Based on recent experience in states where the competitive market is used to determine insurance rates, the study suggests a movement away from rate regulation and cartel pricing to open competition, as a means of eliminating prevailing performance problems.},

Two of the three interactions tested, however, have an impact that is in the direction opposite to that predicted. In addition, firm-specific factors, such as product mix and profitability, appear to explain the corporate decision to purchase reinsurance.},

The size of the loading fees and how they vary by employer group size have important implications for health policy given the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Despite their policy relevance, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on the magnitude and the determinants of health insurance loading fees. This paper provides estimates of the loading fees by firm size using data from the confidential Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component–Insurance Component Linked File. Overall, we find an inverse relationship between employer group size and loading fees. Firms of up to 100 employees face similar loading fees of approximately 34%. Loads decline with firm size and are estimated to be on average 15% for firms with more than 100 employees, but less than 10,000 employees, and 4% for firms with more than 10,000 workers.},

Thus, ownership structures and distribution systems are strategic complements.

It is important to understand the fundamental differences between the two systems to gain insights into their disparate treatment of catastrophe risk financing. Although policies could be improved in both jurisdictions, we argue that the much greater reform is needed in the United States relative to the EU regulatory policies that are being developed. We offer recommendations on how U.S. policies could be significantly improved as well as comment on issues facing the EU.

By carrying out laboratory sessions of this game in which subjects' overconfidence is a treatment variable, I find that overconfidence affects the information aggregation process by increasing the dispersion of estimates and decreasing the rate of estimates' convergence. However, even when subjects are not overconfident, qualitatively similar deviations from the fully rational model predictions are observed. I show that this can be explained by subjects' strategic response to errors.},

   abstract = {Most existing work on the demand for health insurance focuses on employees’ decisions to enroll in employer-provided plans. Yet any attempt to achieve universal coverage must focus on the uninsured, the vast majority of whom are not offered employer-sponsored insurance. In the summer of 2008, we conducted a survey experiment to assess the willingness to pay for a health plan among a large sample of uninsured Americans. The experiment yields price elasticities of around one, substantially greater than those found in most previous studies. We use these results to estimate coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act, with and without an individual mandate. We estimate that 35 million uninsured individuals would gain coverage and find limited evidence of adverse selection.},

   abstract = {Hurricane Katrina illustrates the natural disaster syndrome. Prior to a disaster, individuals in hazard-prone regions do not voluntarily adopt cost-effective loss reduction measures. The federal government then comes to the rescue with disaster assistance even if it claimed it had no intention of doing so prior to the event. There are a number of reasons why individuals do not protect themselves prior to a disaster. They underestimate the likelihood of a future disaster, often believing that it will not happen to them; have budget constraints; are myopic in their behavior; and/or do not want to be the only one on the block modifying their structure. Given this lack of interest in voluntary protection, benefit-cost analysis can determine when a well-enforced building code would be appropriate. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships as a way of reducing future disaster losses and aiding the recovery process.},

Two hundred and forty five insurance agents in the U.S. were surveyed, with 59% responding. The results suggest that the SCCS does not significantly affect agents' ethical intentions, positively or negatively. This lack of empirical evidence may be due to the unique nature of the sample. Indeed, the company which enabled this sample appears to have found a practical solution to temper the potential negative effects of the SCCS in its commitment to selective hiring and marketing products which benefit both the client and the agent.},

A successfully completed exchange offer significantly reduces the likelihood that a firm will enter Chapter 11.

The company's risk (and simultaneously its potential profit) is reduced through reinsurance, while in addition the company invests its surplus in a financial market. Our main goal is to find an optimal reinsurance-investment policy which minimizes the probability of ruin. More specifically, in this paper we consider the case of proportional reinsurance, and investment in a Black-Scholes market with one risk-free asset (bond, or bank account) and one risky asset (stock). We apply stochastic control theory to solve this problem. It transpires that the qualitative nature of the solution depends significantly on the interplay between the exogenous parameters and the constraints that we impose on the investment, such as the presence or absence of shortselling and/or borrowing. In each case we solve the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and find a closed-form expression for the minimal ruin probability as well as the optimal reinsurance-investment policy.},

These employers are more likely to offer insurance and to make greater contributions in communities with tighter labor markets, less concentrated labor purchasers, greater union penetration, and a greater share of workers in big business and a small share in regulated industries. However, our data do not support the notion that marginal tax rates affect employers' offer decision or contributions.},

Second, it analyzes a game of choice of retailing channels between rival manufacturers. Depending on the extent of the adverse selection problem and on the complementarity or substitutability of their brands, manufacturers prefer to use either a common or an exclusive retailer.},

   pages = {337-348},
   abstract = {This paper considers both the incentives for and the welfare effects of resale price maintenance (RPM) in retail markets characterized by imperfect consumer information. In markets where point-of-sale information on the product is essential for sales and information on prices is costly, RPM permits manufacturers with some monopoly power to resolve two incentive conflicts with retailers. First, because retailers with price-setting powers do not appropriate the gains in profit to an upstream manufacturer from actions taken to increase demand, their incentives to inform consumers of the product and to set low prices are inadequate. This purely vertical externality results in the classic “double mark-up” of final prices. Second, when consumers' costs of price search vary, stores offering low prices and no information can exist in the market equilibrium. These discount houses free-ride on the informational services of high-price informing retail outlets — a horizontal externality. In the imperfect information setting of this paper, (1) administered pricing improves monopolists' profits by resolving the incentive conflict; (2) the profitable use of a price floor reduces the maximum retail price charged and may reduce the average retail price; (3) price floors or administered prices can be Pareto-improving and more likely welfare (surplus)-improving; (4) price floors are welfare-improving.},

   pages = {1728-1733},
   abstract = {The long-term trend of consolidation among US health plans has raised providers' concerns that the concentration of health plan markets can depress their prices. Although our study confirmed that, it also revealed a more complex picture. First, we found that 64 percent of hospitals operate in markets where health plans are not very concentrated, and only 7 percent are in markets that are dominated by a few health plans. Second, we found that in most markets, hospital market concentration exceeds health plan concentration. Third, our study confirmed earlier studies showing that greater hospital market concentration leads to higher hospital prices. Fourth, we found that hospital prices in the most concentrated health plan markets are approximately 12 percent lower than in more competitive health plan markets. Overall, our results show that more concentrated health plan markets can counteract the price-increasing effects of concentrated hospital markets, and that-contrary to conventional wisdom-increased health plan concentration benefits consumers through lower hospital prices as long as health plan markets remain competitive. Our findings also suggest that consumers would benefit from policies that maintained competition in hospital markets or that would restore competition to hospital markets that are uncompetitive.

   abstract = {The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.},

As with other forms of insurance, the issuing of a guarantee imposes a liability or cost on the guarantor. In this paper, a formula is derived to evaluate this cost.

Out of the 771 firms classified as hedgers, 543 firms disclose information in their annual reports on their hedging activities; the remaining 228 firms report use of derivatives but no information on hedging activities. Based on the evidence, I draw the following conclusions with respect to the models of hedging: evidence is inconsistent with financial distress cost models; evidence is mixed with respect to contracting cost, capital market imperfections, and tax-based models; and evidence uniformly supports the hypothesis that hedging activities exhibit economies of scale.},

It therefore creates substantial transactional inefficiencies for buyers and sellers of real estate at both the matching and bargaining stages of a brokerage transaction.

The poorer health and shorter lives of those without coverage account for most of these costs. Other impacts are manifested by Medicare and disability support payments, demands on the public health infrastructure, and losses of local health service capacity. We conclude that the estimated value of health forgone each year because of uninsurance ($65-$130 billion) constitutes a lower-bound estimate of economic losses resulting from the present level of uninsurance nationally.},

Using three years of panel data, we estimate how insurer and hospital market concentration are related to hospital prices, while controlling for unobserved market effects. We find that increases in insurance market concentration are significantly associated with decreases in hospital prices, whereas increases in hospital concentration are non-significantly associated with increases in prices. A hypothetical merger between two of five equally sized insurers is estimated to decrease hospital prices by 6.7%.},

The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.},

The two models give different values only if the loss payment is asymmetric and correlated with the market portfolio, conditions which can result from the nature of the underlying loss or from the impact of insolvency on the insurer's payment. In examples where insolvency is not possible and there is no liquidity cost of raising new equity on short notice, the value of a loss liability is equal to the value of the underlying loss, i.e., of the promised coverage, and depends neither on (1) the size of the loss pool; nor on (2) the unsystematic risk of the insurer's liabilities; nor on (3) the composition of an insurer's investment portfolio; nor on (4) the amount of insurer equity. These factors do affect the value of a loss liability in examples where insolvency and liquidity costs are considered. Other things equal, if a factor increases the likelihood of insolvency, the fair value of a loss liability is lower because the insured is partially self-insuring; but the liquidity cost of maintaining solvency by raising new equity on short notice is higher, implying a higher fair value of the loss liability.},

When looking at the economic importance of the insurance sector, most papers in the past have looked at the demand side (the level of economic development is an explanatory variable among other factors that affect the demand for insurance). Because the role of the insurance sector and its contribution to development is at the agenda of international organizations and because the importance of the relationship between financial development and economic growth has been well recognized and emphasized in the field of economic development, more recent papers have examined the causality links between insurance and economic development and the role of insurance as a significant determinant in the process of economic growth.

We simulate the impact of adverse selection on the consumption allocation of annuitants under alternative parameter values, and explore the resulting welfare implications. We show that, for most parameter values, the welfare losses associated with equilibriums that are subject to adverse selection correspond to a loss of wealth of around one percent in a first-best equilibrium. These losses are smaller than the corresponding losses associated with equilibriums with no access to an annuity market by an order of magnitude of ten. The existence of substitutes for annuities such as a bequest motive or a social security system intensifies the adverse selection but reduces its welfare impact. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

However, the internationalization strategies of such firms, and especially their distribution system choices, have been underexplored in the international management literature. One specific service industry that has internationalized rapidly in recent years is the insurance industry. This paper examines the determinants and performance implications of the choice by international insurance firms between two rival distribution systems: direct writing and independent sales agents. Drawing on the transaction cost theory-based literature on resource commitment, control, and risk, we develop hypotheses on the determinants of the choice between these two distribution systems and on the performance implications of this choice for insurance firms. Analyzing a sample of 168 distribution entries into the United States by insurance firms from six foreign countries over the 1992–2000 period, we find that cultural distance has a U-shaped effect on the probability of direct writing, and that an insurer's intangible assets have a positive effect on this probability. We also find that the direct writing system performs better in terms of profitability, but that the independent agency system performs better in terms of market share growth.},

We found that profits were significantly lower on average in 1994 in markets with more competition, measured alternatively by the number of HMOs or their market concentration. We also found that there was no relationship between a market's relative profit ranking in 1994 and its ranking in 1997; highly profitable markets were not able to preserve their relative standing. Neither the proportion of HMO enrollees in for-profit HMOs nor HMO market penetration was significantly related to profit rates.},

   abstract = {This paper lays out a decomposition of book-to-price (B/P) that derives from the accounting for book value and that articulates precisely how B/P â€œabsorbsâ€ leverage. The B/P ratio can be decomposed into an enterprise book-to-price (that pertains to operations and potentially reflects operating risk) and a leverage component (that reflects financing risk). The empirical analysis shows that the enterprise book-to-price ratio is positively related to subsequent stock returns but, conditional upon the enterprise book-to-price, the leverage component of B/P is negatively associated with future stock returns. Further, both enterprise book-to-price and leverage explain returns over those associated with Fama and French nominated factorsâ€”including the book-to-price factorâ€”albeit negatively so for leverage. The seemingly perverse finding with respect to the leverage component of B/P survives under controls for size, estimated beta, return volatility, momentum, and default risk.

   abstract = {This paper uses a contingent claims framework to develop a financial pricing model of insurance that overcomes one of the main shortcomings of previous models -- the inability to price insurance by line in a multiple line insurer subject to default risk. The model predicts prices will vary across firms depending upon firm default risk, but within a given insurer prices should not vary after controlling for line-specific liability growth rates. We also analyze an important qualification to this result for insurance groups, where several insurer subsidiaries are owned by a primary insurer or holding company. Empirical tests using data on publicly traded property-liability insurers support the hypotheses: prices vary across firms depending upon overall-firm default risk and the concentration of business among subsidiaries; but within a given firm, prices do not vary by line after adjusting for line-specific liability growth rates.},

   abstract = {This paper investigares the market's reaction to securities issuances by insurance companies.  We argue that private information associated with an insurance company's asset portfolio will increase the market's expectation of adverse selection by the firm's managers.  Thus we would expect and observe a more severe, vis a vis commercial banks, market reaction to insurance company equity offerings.  The magnitude of this announcement period return, -3.09 percent, is more than double the announcement period returns reported in the literature for commercial banks, and is similar in magnitude to the reported announcement period returns for non-financial firms.  The results for other types of securities offereings, debt and preferred stock, are uniformly negativee and are similar in magnitude to the returns reported in the non-fincancial firm literature.  Given the phenomena of multiple equity issuances we have the opportunity to examine the signaling models of Welch (1989) and Gale and Stiglitz (1989).  As is the case for commercial banks, multiple offerings of equity generate a significant negative market reaction. This evidence is consistent with the Gale and Stiglitz signaling model.  Thus the market, concerned with the problem of adverse selection, views any insurance company equity offering as a negative signal of firm value.},

   abstract = {The lingering belief that environmental regulations erode competitiveness has resulted in a stalemate. One side pushes for tougher standards, the other tries to roll standards back. The prevailing view is that there is an inherent and fixed trade-off: ecology versus the economy. On one side are the social benefits that arise from environmental standards. On the other side are the private costs to industry of prevention and cleanup that lead to higher prices and reduced industrial competitiveness. This static view, in which everything except regulation is held constant, ignores the fact that companies are constantly finding innovative solutions in response to pressures of all sorts--from competitors, from customers, from regulators. The authors' research shows that tougher environmental standards can enhance competitiveness by pushing companies to use resources more productively. The concept of resource productivity opens up a new way of looking at this complex issue. Today managers and regulators focus on the actual costs of eliminating or treating pollution. To end the stalemate, they should focus instead on the enormous opportunity costs of pollution--wasted resources, wasted effort, and diminished product value to the customer. Managers must start to recognize environmental improvement as an economic and competitive opportunity, not as an annoying cost or an inevitable threat. Environmental progress demands that companies innovate to raise resource productivity-precisely the new challenge of global competition. It is time to build on the underlying economic logic that links the environment, resource productivity, innovation, and competitiveness.

These issues are illustrated using medical loss ratios from a range of nonprofit and for-profit health plans. The paper then sketches a strategy for improving the public's understanding of health plan performance as an alternative to continued reliance on the flawed medical loss ratio.

The lagged market response presents the possibility that markets are not semi-strong efficient with respect to pension freezes. In this regard, our results corroborate recent work from other researchers who have found various market inefficiencies related to defined benefit pensions.},

We first show that overconfidence may overturn fundamental relations between observable variables in perfect-competition asymmetric information insurance markets. In monopolistic insurance markets, in constrast, we find that overconfidence may be observationally equivalent to variations in the risk composition of the economy. Our analysis provides a number of novel testable implications on (i) price heterogeneity within and across risk classes, (ii) the relationship between ex-post risk and insurance coverage, (iii) the fact that a significant fraction of agents chooses to be uninsured, and (iv) the relationship between underinsurance and age. Further, some insights from previous behavioral economics studies may also be reversed: (i) in the case of perfect competition, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that an increase in overconfidence and a reduction in risk aversion may have opposite effects on insurance coverage; (ii) we find that monopolists cannot exploit biased customers, and their profits decrease in the fraction of overconfident agents in the economy.},

According to the findings, both the uninsured rate and health care spending share are directly related to the percentage of health insurance articles published in the JRI. Thus, the empirical results suggest that the research decisions of insurance economists are influenced at the margin by real-world problems.},

Moreover, certain measurement issues such as the lack of data on PPO enrollment, the treatment of small firms, and omitted market characteristics also could affect the conclusions in empirical studies. Importantly, other types of measures related to competition (e.g., the availability of information on price and outcomes, degree of entry barriers, etc.) are important from both a theoretical and policy perspective, but their impact on market outcomes has not been widely studied.},

Insurers then set prices, cognizant of the prices of their competitors, modeled here as a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium. The addition of a cost to consumers for switching insurers is shown to give incumbents a degree of monopoly power in setting prices. Adding costly consumer price search further reduces the market share of new entrants. However, those consumers that do switch to a new insurer have strong preferences for that insurer and, as a result, it is possible that new-entrant prices will exceed those of incumbent insurers.},

We then estimate a multivariable regression model to examine the relationship between concentration measures and the prices paid by HPs to POs. Price data is from Medstat MarketScan databases. The findings show that any California counties exhibit what the Department of Justice would consider high HHI concentration measures, in excess of 1,800. More than three quarters of California counties exhibit HP concentration indices over 1,800, and 83% of counties have PO concentration levels in excess of 1,800. Half of the study counties exhibited PO concentration levels in excess of 3,600, compared to only 24% for plans. Multivariate price models suggest that PO concentration is associated with higher physician prices (p < 0.05), whereas HP concentration does not appear to be significantly associated with higher outpatient commercial payer prices.},

We use a sample consisting of observations on forty-seven publicly traded insurance firms over the years 1994 through 2004.

We measure wealth as the holding period return, as market value and as cash dividends. We relate these measures of wealth to a set of explanatory variables that include a measure of reinsurance usage. We find a statistically strong positive relationship between reinsurance usage and stockholder wealth but the economic significance of the resulting wealth increase is weak.},

   abstract = {Job changes that result from plant closings and mass layoffs provide an opportunity to see how workers respond to an employment shock that is arguably exogenous to individual productivity. Comparing compensation packages of displaced workers on their old and new jobs is a potentially promising method to infer a tradeoff between wages and non-wage benefits. Although displaced worker data overcomes many of the pitfalls to estimating wage/fringe tradeoffs by controlling for time-invariant unobserved productivity, time-varying unobservables could still bias estimates. In this analysis, I investigate the compensating wage differential for one particularly valuable benefit, employer-provided health insurance. I find that even after controlling for an extensive set of productivity factors, I obtain results indicating a wrong-signed tradeoff. Those who lose health insurance through the job change also lose wages relative to other displaced workers, while those who gain health insurance also gain in wages. Individuals expected to incur higher health care costs (older workers and workers who are likely to buy family coverage) do not experience steeper wage/health insurance tradeoffs as would be expected if employers were able to pass health care costs on to workers according to individual costs. Although this exercise fails to isolate a wage/fringe tradeoff, the strong correlation between changes in wages and changes in fringe benefits has important implications for public policy towards displaced workers. Further research is needed to understand the true magnitude and distribution of the costs of job displacement taking changes in fringe benefits into account.},

Tests for the effect of this arbitrage indicate that tax-exempt/taxable yield ratios for bond maturities lying near 5 and 10 years also have affected yields to holders of insurance.},

Event studies have been used to address a variety of political economy questions from the economic effects of party control of government to the importance of complex rules in congressional committees. However, the results of event studies are notoriously sensitive to both choices made by researchers and external events. Specifically, event studies will generally produce different results depending on three interrelated things: which event window is chosen, the prior probability assigned to an event at the beginning of the event window, and the presence or absence of other events during the event window. In this paper we show how each of these may bias the results of event studies, and how prediction markets can mitigate these biases.},

This implies that property-liability insurers are penalized for default risk through lower prices, despite the existence of guaranty funds. Other firm-specific determinants of insurance prices are also identified. The results have significant implications for insurance researchers and regulators.},

The present work sets out to explore the non-quantitative aspects of the interface between banks and insurance firms. Without discounting any quantitative analysis, the study diverts from the existing literature by placing equal weight to the so far overlooked qualitative elements. The paper reviews the various market trends and highlights the differences among major European countries. The diverse and inconclusive bancassurance literature is also briefly reviewed. Having discussed the cultural differences and integration obstacles between banks and insurance firms, the study proposes a three-dimensional radar-shape approach for the financial conglomerate. More specifically, product complexity, distribution infrastructure and market integration are put forward as the forcing variables underlying the provision platform of modern hybrid financial services. The analysis further elaborates on a number of market-based synthetic corporate structures drawn from the European experience as a whole. Finally, two broad drivers &#8211; exogenous (market) and idiosyncratic (operational and strategic) &#8211; along with their constituents, mainly held responsible for the success/risk of the new universal financial intermediary, are identified and analysed. The paper concludes by summarizing the main issues and pointing to avenues for potential research.The Geneva Papers (2006) 31, 124&#8211;148. doi:10.1057/palgrave.gpp.2510060},

Specific attention is given to traditional theories regarding capital structure, including the tradeoff between the tax benefits and increasing probability of incurring the cost of financial distress associated with leverage, and the tradeoff between protecting franchise or charter value and expropriating value through increasing exposure to interest rate risk. Within this framework, the relation between leverage, interest rate sensitivity and firm value is investigated in the property-liability insurance industry. Equity value, as gauged by Tobin's q, is determined to be related to an insurer's choice of financial structure. It is shown that the market value of equity at first grows but then later declines as leverage increases. Interest rate risk has the opposite effect. Equity value first declines with interest rate risk, but then rises at high levels of interest rate risk. These results are consistent with the prediction that financial institutions will expend scarce resources to control risk in order to protect franchise value and may indeed be signaling the existence of these valuable intangibles via these actions.},

Familiar cases of such claims include options on a portfolio of options, options whose exercise price is stochastic, and options to exchange one asset for another. This paper derives risk neutral valuation relationships (RNVRs) in a discrete time setting that facilitate the pricing of such complex contingent claims in two specific cases: joint lognormally distributed underlying variables and constant proportional risk aversion on the part of investors, and joint normally distributed underlying variables and constant absolute risk aversion preferences, respectively. This methodology is then applied to the valuation of several interesting complex contingent claims such as multiperiod bonds, multicurrency option bonds, and investment options.

In the model we endogenize the investment choice as well as firm value, which are both determined by an exogenous price process that describes the firm's product market. Within the context of this model we explore cross-sectional as well as time-series variation in debt ratios. We pay particular attention to interactions between financial distress costs and debtholder/equityholder agency problems and examine how the ability to dynamically adjust the debt ratio affects the deviation of actual debt ratios from their targets. Regressions estimated on simulated data generated by our model are roughly consistent with actual regressions estimated in the empirical literature.},

   abstract = {We provide a separating equilibrium explanation for the existence of the independent insurance agent system despite the potentially higher costs of this system compared to those of the exclusive agents system (or direct underwriting). A model is developed assuming asymmetric information between insurers and insureds; the former do not know the riskiness of the latter. We also assume that the claims service provided by the independent agent system to its clients is superior to that offered by direct underwriting system, that is, insureds using the independent agent system are more likely to receive reimbursement of their claims. Competition compels the insurers to provide within their own system the best contract to the insured. It is shown that in equilibrium the safer insureds choose direct underwriting, whereas the riskier ones choose independent agents. The predictions of the model agree with previous research demonstrating that the independent agent system is costlier than direct underwriting. The present model suggests that this does not result from inefficiency but rather from self-selection. The empirical implication of this analysis is that, ceteris paribus, the incidence of claims made by clients of the independent agents system is higher than that of clients of direct underwriting. Implications for the coexistence of different distribution systems due to unbundling of services in other industries such as brokerage houses and the health care industry are discussed.},

Reinsurance is hypothesized to be a potential factor in observed cycles in the primary market; despite this, few underwriting cycle studies focus on reinsurance. The purpose of this research is to investigate determinants of reinsurance prices in the U.S. Nonproportional reinsurance is highlighted, since it is designed to cover the tail of the loss distribution and is considered to be relatively riskier than proportional reinsurance as a result. Separate samples of professional U.S. reinsurers for property and for casualty are studied, based upon the reinsurers' writings of property versus casualty nonproportional reinsurance. The sample period is 1991–1995. The results support both the capacity constraint hypothesis and the risky debt hypothesis, and this is the first research to support both. A major innovation in this study is the use of capacity variables that are broken down by major region of the world.},

By applying a simultaneous equations model to cross-sectional and time-series firm-level data, this study proposes that insurers' net investment income can be used to explain both hypotheses regarding processes for establishing premiums and reserves. Our results confirm that the industry cycle phenomenon is reflected in individual firm dynamics. We find that net investment income is inversely related to both premiums and loss reserves, as expected, and we identify how the magnitudes of these effects correspond to the phases of the underwriting cycle. The results indicate that the effects are greatest in the hard market of underwriting cycles. Moreover, the yearly differential responses of premiums and reserves to net investment income are coincident with the formation of cycles.},

This study examines the correlation between catastrophe risk securities and portfolios of other equities by analyzing catastrophe effects on the Japanese stock market.

Design/methodology/approach – Using catastrophe data from SwissRe Sigma publications and stock returns from the Pacific-Basin Capital Markets database, this paper analyzes stock and abnormal returns in the Japanese stock market using event study methodology.

Findings – For the Japanese stock market as a whole, there is no significant catastrophe effect. The results indicate a significant negative correlation between catastrophe loss amount and the insurance industry's equity returns and abnormal returns, a significant positive correlation with the construction industry, but no significant correlation with the real estate industry. This paper also analyzes the impact of catastrophe causalities. The results show little evidence on the significance of these variables.

Originality/value – This study provides important insights to the insurance/reinsurance industry in the Japanese risk market for catastrophe property and mortality risk securitization and to investors who are interested in further improvement of their portfolio risk/return profile by including catastrophe risk securities.},
